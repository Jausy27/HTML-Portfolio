<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>INTERSTELLAR</h3>
<p>This is plausibly one of the greatest sci-fi movies ever made.The movie is about how NASA looks for life outside Earth and beyond our galaxy.</p>

<h3>PRIMAL FEAR</h3>
<p>This is a one heck of a thriller-Court Room Drama.The film is so gripping with ridiculously good acting</p>

<h3>AVATAAR</h3>
<p>This is a colourful masterpiece by James Cameroon.The visuals and VFX in the movie is simply breathtaking.</p>
